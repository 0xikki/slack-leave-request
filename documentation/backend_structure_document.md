# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

This document explains how the backend of our time-off and PTO management system is set up. The backend handles everything that isn't directly seen in the Slack interface but is essential to making sure that leave requests work as expected. When a user enters the `/leave` command in Slack, a modal is triggered, and all the logic from validations to notifications is handled by the backend. This setup is designed to be straightforward so that users and team members can understand how the system works, even if they aren't technical experts.

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built using Python and follows a modular design that separates different functionalities into clear components. The current structure is:

```
src/
├── __init__.py
├── app.py                    # Main application entry point (65% coverage)
├── config/
│   └── organization.py       # Organization structure and configs (90% coverage)
└── slack/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── helpers.py           # Shared helper functions (100% coverage)
    ├── slack_actions.py     # Action handlers (82% coverage)
    ├── slack_commands.py    # Command handlers (67% coverage)
    └── slack_helpers.py     # Additional helper functions (needs coverage)
```

The command handling, modal processing, and approval workflows are each managed by independent sections of the application. This approach makes it easier to update, debug, and extend the system. The design focuses on maintainability and performance by minimizing dependencies and using simple, well-documented code. This ensures that as the system grows, it remains reliable and quick to respond to requests.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

The system maintains a comprehensive test suite with:
- 37 unit tests covering core functionality
- Overall code coverage of 72%
- Key modules like helpers.py achieving 100% coverage
- Continuous testing during development

Areas identified for improvement:
- Increase coverage for slack_commands.py (currently 67%)
- Add tests for slack_helpers.py
- Enhance app.py coverage (currently 65%)

## Database Management

In this first version of the system, there is no persistent data store since work is managed live through Slack interactions. The system relies on real-time data processing, meaning no data is saved permanently in a traditional database. This keeps the backend lightweight and simplifies the overall workflow. If future requirements call for data persistence, the system can be extended to include either SQL or NoSQL databases based on needs for structured or flexible data storage.

## API Design and Endpoints

The backend uses a RESTful approach to interact with Slack's API. Specific endpoints are set up to handle the incoming requests from the `/leave` slash command and to process the form data from the modal. There are also endpoints for sending notifications back to users and for handling admin approval workflows. These endpoints are designed to be simple and intuitive, ensuring smooth communication between Slack and the backend service. Each endpoint carries out its function in a clear way, reducing the complexity of the code and ensuring that all parts of the system work together seamlessly.

## Hosting Solutions

Our backend is deployed on Vultr, a cloud hosting provider known for its reliability and cost-effectiveness. Vultr provides a robust environment with 24/7 availability, which is essential for the always-on nature of our service. The choice of Vultr ensures that the backend can handle high volumes of requests efficiently while also keeping costs predictable. The cloud infrastructure provided by Vultr lets us scale up resources as needed without a significant overhaul of the underlying system architecture.

## Infrastructure Components

Several infrastructure components work behind the scenes to provide a smooth user experience. The system relies on load balancers to ensure that incoming requests are evenly distributed, which helps maintain high performance during peak times. Caching mechanisms are in place to quickly retrieve frequently accessed data, even though in this initial phase, the system handles data in real time. Additionally, content delivery networks (CDNs) help distribute static content and manage network traffic efficiently. These components collaborate to keep the service responsive and reliable for every user interacting with the Slack app.

## Security Measures

Security is a priority in this backend setup, particularly because it involves sensitive information like leave request details. The system uses practical approaches to protect user data and maintain integrity:

1. Authentication and Authorization:
   - Proper verification of Slack request signatures
   - Role-based access control (department heads, HR admins)
   - Strict validation of user permissions for approvals

2. Data Protection:
   - Secure transmission using HTTPS
   - Environment-based configuration
   - No persistent storage of sensitive data

These measures ensure compliance with relevant regulations and protect user privacy.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To keep the system running smoothly, we have implemented:

1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Comprehensive test suite with 37 unit tests
   - Regular coverage reporting
   - Automated test runs during development

2. Logging and Monitoring:
   - JSON-formatted logging
   - Error tracking and reporting
   - Performance monitoring

3. Maintenance Procedures:
   - Regular code reviews
   - Continuous test coverage improvement
   - Documentation updates

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend of our time-off and PTO system is carefully designed to work reliably with Slack and deliver a seamless experience for users. The architecture is modular and well-tested, with key components achieving high test coverage. Through the use of a RESTful API design, secure communication, and thoughtful infrastructure choices like Vultr hosting and load balancers, the backend stands as a robust foundation for handling leave requests within Slack. The absence of a persistent database in this phase is a deliberate choice, keeping the system agile until further data management needs arise. Overall, the backend setup is both practical for current requirements and adaptable for future expansion.
