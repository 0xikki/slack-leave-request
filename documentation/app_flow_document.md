# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is built as a Slack-integrated time-off and leave request system. Its main goal is to allow users to quickly submit leave requests using Slack, and for designated department heads and HR to review, approve, or deny these requests right within the Slack environment. The experience is completely self-contained in Slack, meaning users will never need to leave their familiar workspace. Overall, the application streamlines the process of taking leave, ensuring that all interactions — from initiation to notification — are efficient and simple.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Since the system is designed exclusively for Slack, there is no traditional onboarding process involving sign-ups or sign-ins through a web interface. Instead, any user who is already part of the Slack workspace can simply start using the system by typing the slash command `/timeoff`. The authentication and user identification happen automatically via Slack's own user management. Users do not need to sign out or recover passwords within the application because all credentials are managed by Slack. In this way, the onboarding process is as seamless as typing the command into Slack and immediately seeing the corresponding modal interface.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

When a user initiates the leave request process by typing `/timeoff` in any Slack channel, the system immediately brings up a modal window at the center of the screen. This modal acts as the main 'dashboard' for the leave request process. It presents the user with all the necessary fields to complete their request, such as:
- Date selection (start date)
- Type of leave
- Reason for leave
- Tasks that need coverage
- Person who will cover their responsibilities

The modal provides clear guidance on what each field expects, with validation to ensure all required information is provided.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user submits their leave request through the modal, the following workflow is triggered:

1. Initial Request:
   - The system validates all required fields
   - Upon successful validation, the request is routed based on the user's role

2. Routing Logic:
   - For regular employees:
     * Request is sent to their department head
     * Department head receives a message with approve/reject buttons
   - For department heads:
     * Request is sent directly to the HR channel
     * HR team receives a message with approve/reject buttons

3. Approval Process:
   - The approver (department head or HR) sees:
     * Request details (type, dates, reason)
     * Approve button (with confirmation dialog)
     * Reject button (opens rejection reason modal)
   
4. Action Handling:
   - On Approval:
     * Original message is updated to show approved status
     * Requester receives a notification of approval
     * If department head approved, request is forwarded to HR
   - On Rejection:
     * Approver must provide a reason
     * Original message is updated to show rejected status
     * Requester receives a notification with the rejection reason

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The system includes robust error handling at multiple levels:

1. Modal Validation:
   - Required fields are checked before submission
   - Clear error messages guide users to fix issues
   - Date validation ensures proper formatting

2. Action Handling:
   - Authorization checks prevent unauthorized approvals/rejections
   - Network errors are caught and logged
   - Users receive clear feedback if something goes wrong

3. Process Safeguards:
   - Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental approvals/rejections
   - Rejection requires a reason to ensure clear communication
   - Super admins can handle any request regardless of department

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The application provides a streamlined, Slack-native experience for leave management:

1. Request Initiation:
   - User types `/timeoff` in any channel
   - Modal opens with required fields
   - User fills in details and submits

2. Review Process:
   - Request routes to appropriate approver
   - Approver reviews details and takes action
   - System handles notifications and updates

3. Completion:
   - All parties receive appropriate notifications
   - Message updates reflect current status
   - Process completes entirely within Slack

This end-to-end workflow minimizes friction while maintaining proper oversight and communication channels for leave management.
